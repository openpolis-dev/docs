# API Endpoints Overview
This guide provides essential information on how to interact with the API endpoints effectively to achieve seamless integration and automation using our models.

### Authentication

To ensure secure access to the API, authentication is required 🛡️. You can authenticate your API requests using the Bearer Token or X-API-Key. Obtain your API key from Profile > SeeChat in the SeeDAO OS.
